# Relativity-Based Code

This repository contains code for running simulations and calculations related to General and Special Relativity using Python.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.8 or later). You can check your version by running:

```sh
python --version
```

## Installation

Install the required dependencies by running:

```sh
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib einsteinpy
```

## Running the Code
To execute the relativity-based scripts, use:

```sh
python script_name.py
```
Replace `script_name.py` with the name of the script you want to run.

## Notes
- Ensure all dependencies are installed before running the scripts.
- Modify initial conditions in your scripts to explore different scenarios.
